## The Growing Importance of Web Scraping

Web scraping enables businesses to collect large volumes of structured data from websites for use cases like price monitoring, market research, lead generation, and more.

Recent surveys reveal that over 60% of data professionals use web scraping for their initiatives. Interestingly, only 15% of them rely on self-built scrapers, while nearly 50% prefer third-party scraping tools or APIs due to the challenges of building custom solutions.

### Common Challenges of Building Custom Scrapers:
- Dealing with dynamic websites and JavaScript rendering.
- Overcoming anti-scraping measures like CAPTCHAs.
- Managing proxies and IP rotation at scale.
- Avoiding disruptions to target websites.
- Integrating scraped data seamlessly into internal systems.

This is where web scraping APIs shineâ€”offering a streamlined way to extract data without the complexities of building and maintaining custom scrapers.

const { body } = await client.get('https://example.com', { render: true });
console.log(body);
```

### Solving CAPTCHAs

### Proxy Rotation
Scraping APIs use automated proxy rotation to prevent IP bans. For instance, ScraperAPI allows you to customize proxy rules:
```python
client.set_proxy_rotation(5)
for page in range(1, 20):
    client.get(f'https://site.com/page/{page}')
```
