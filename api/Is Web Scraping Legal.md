### Definition

Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites using software programs. According to Wikipedia:

> **Web scraping**, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is a technique for extracting data from websites through software programs.

There are two main approaches to web scraping:

1. **Manual Web Scraping**: Involves copy-pasting data manually. While simple, it‚Äôs not practical for handling large datasets.
2. **Automated Web Scraping**: Uses specialized software, called web scrapers, to extract data by simulating user navigation on websites.

### How Web Scrapers Operate

Web scrapers typically perform the following steps:

1. Send an HTTP GET request to the target website.
2. Analyze the HTML document to locate the desired data.

This process usually takes only a few minutes, depending on the scraper and the data volume.
