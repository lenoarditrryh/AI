### Example: Node.js Script for Google Maps Scraping

Hereâ€™s a simple Node.js script to scrape Google Maps search results and reviews:

```javascript
const request = require('request-promise');

const keyword = process.argv[2]; // Search keyword (e.g., "restaurants New York")
const apiKey = 'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key

const options = {
  uri: `https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=${apiKey}&url=https://www.google.com/maps/search/${encodeURIComponent(keyword)}`,
  json: true,
};

request(options)
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Search Results:', data);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error:', err.message);
  });
```

### Running the Script

Save the script as `scrape-google-maps.js` and run it using Node.js:

```bash
node scrape-google-maps.js "restaurants New York"
```

### Expected Output

The script retrieves search results with detailed information, such as:

- **Title**: Business name or location
- **Address**: Full address
- **Phone Number**
- **Category**: Type of business (e.g., hotel, restaurant)
- **Rating and Reviews**: Average rating and total review count
- **Coordinates**: Latitude and longitude

### Advanced: Scraping Reviews for a Specific Location

To retrieve reviews for a specific Google Maps listing, you can use the `place_id` or `fid` from the search results. Update the script to request review details:

```javascript
const options = {
  uri: `https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=${apiKey}&url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/details/json?place_id=PLACE_ID`,
  json: true,
};

request(options)
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Reviews:', data.reviews);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error:', err.message);
  });
```
