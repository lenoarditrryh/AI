# Collecting Real Estate Data: How to Centralize Insights and Unlock Potential

The real estate industry deals with vast amounts of data‚Äîfrom tenant leases to property management records and demographic statistics. Despite the potential to derive actionable insights, many firms struggle to utilize their data effectively due to siloed storage systems. Centralizing this data into one searchable location can unlock its full potential, saving time and enabling better research capabilities. Here's how firms can overcome common data challenges and improve efficiency.

## Why Real Estate Firms Struggle with Data

Real estate companies often find themselves bogged down by fragmented and inaccessible data. Tenant leases, rental rates, and external market information are often stored in separate spreadsheets or databases that don't communicate with each other. This makes even simple research tasks cumbersome and time-consuming.

Kevin Mattice, Chief Product Officer at Cherre, explains, ‚ÄúReal estate companies have a lot of data but don‚Äôt get to use it because it‚Äôs in silos. Spreadsheets and outdated internal platforms limit their ability to generate actionable insights.‚Äù

Even when proprietary internal data is relatively organized, integrating external data sources often requires APIs or advanced data warehouses‚Äîsomething that traditional spreadsheets cannot support. The first step toward better data utilization is moving away from spreadsheets and adopting a centralized data warehouse.

## Why Spreadsheets Fall Short

Spreadsheets are widely used across the real estate industry for data storage. Firms often have separate spreadsheets for lease comparisons, tenant inquiries, and rental rate tracking. While initially convenient, this approach leads to disorganized data silos, limiting scalability and collaboration.

Even with organized internal data, integrating external datasets purchased from third-party providers adds another layer of complexity. Without proper APIs or advanced tools, combining internal and external data becomes an uphill task.

**The Solution:** Transition to a centralized data warehouse. This eliminates data silos and lays the foundation for scalable insights.

## Consolidating Data: Key Steps for Success

Moving all data into a single, unified data warehouse is not without challenges. However, following a structured approach can make the process more manageable.

### 1. Define Clear Business Goals

Before consolidating data, firms should outline their objectives. What insights do stakeholders want to gain from the data? Without clear goals, projects risk becoming unfocused and disappointing.

Tyler Christensen, Senior Solution Architect at Cherre, emphasizes, ‚ÄúEverything starts with understanding data purpose‚Äîwho‚Äôs producing it, who‚Äôs consuming it, and what the end goals are. The worst-case scenario is spending months on a project that doesn‚Äôt solve its original purpose.‚Äù

### 2. Choose Between DIY or Third-Party Solutions

Firms must decide whether to build their data warehouse in-house or use third-party platforms. Each option has trade-offs:

- **In-House Development:** Offers full control but requires a dedicated team and significant time investment.
- **Third-Party Platforms:** Faster implementation with lower long-term costs. These solutions often include data cleaning and system optimization.

Tyler Khan adds, ‚ÄúUsing a third-party solution can result in faster delivery and reduced costs while ensuring the system is designed to meet specific needs.‚Äù

## Cleaning and Standardizing Data: A Crucial Step

Data cleaning and standardization are critical for any data consolidation project. Poorly cleaned data leads to inconsistencies and defeats the purpose of centralization.

For example, firms must handle complex scenarios like standardizing addresses with multiple formats or dealing with geolocation data. Christensen notes, ‚ÄúWithout proper cleaning, creating a data lake and dumping information in isn‚Äôt going to help. You‚Äôll be back where you started.‚Äù

### Pro Tip:
Allocate significant time and resources to cleaning your data before migrating it into a warehouse. This ensures the resulting system is efficient and reliable.

## Post-Implementation: Maximizing the Value of Data

Once a unified data warehouse is operational, the real benefits begin to unfold. A centralized system allows firms to conduct large-scale analyses that were previously impossible.

### Example: Large-Scale Property Prospecting

Investment firms often search for properties that meet specific criteria. With centralized data, firms can identify opportunities across entire cities or states within hours‚Äîtasks that previously took weeks of manual effort.

### Leverage BI Tools for Additional Value

A well-maintained data warehouse also enables firms to create dashboards and reports using tools like Tableau. These front-end applications enhance decision-making with minimal additional costs.

## Ongoing Maintenance is Key

Building a unified data warehouse is not a one-time project. Maintaining and optimizing the system requires continuous effort, especially as firms acquire new data or integrate with external APIs.

‚ÄúData strategy and architecture aren‚Äôt set-it-and-forget-it jobs,‚Äù says Christensen. ‚ÄúReal estate firms need to adopt a culture of ongoing data management to maximize their ROI.‚Äù

## Unlocking Insights with Unified Data

A unified data warehouse enables real estate firms to eliminate inefficiencies, unlock new research opportunities, and scale their operations. By investing in the right tools and strategies, firms can turn their data from a burden into a competitive advantage.
