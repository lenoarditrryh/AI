## Challenges in Scraping Amazon

Although Amazon Product Scraper can return up to 100,000 results on average, scraping is influenced by several factors:

1. **Input complexity**: The type of input affects the number of results.
2. **Internal limits**: Amazon imposes restrictions based on user behavior.
3. **Scraper limits**: These are continually being improved to handle complex use cases.

The best way to determine scraping efficiency is by running a small-scale test for your specific use case.

## How Much Does Amazon Scraping Cost?

The cost of scraping depends on the scale of your project. Running a test scrape with a limited input size allows you to calculate the price per scrape. You can then multiply this cost by the total number of scrapes you plan to perform.

## Overcoming Amazon's 7-Page Limitation

Amazon sometimes restricts search results to 7 pages. To bypass this:

- Combine categories with search terms. For example, instead of searching for "Diamond rings," search within broader categories like "Jewelry" or "Women's rings."
- Validate the number of pages in your query.
