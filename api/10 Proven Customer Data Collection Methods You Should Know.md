## What Is Customer Data Collection?

Customer data collection is the systematic process of gathering information about your target audience. For eCommerce businesses, this means collecting relevant customer data ethically and legally to improve user experience and drive growth.

### Types of Customer Data:

1. **First-party data**: Data collected directly from your customers (e.g., surveys, website interactions).
2. **Second-party data**: Data shared by another organization about their customers.
3. **Third-party data**: Data purchased or rented from unrelated organizations.

Among these, first-party data is the most reliable and forms the foundation of strategic business decisions.

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data

- **Quantitative Data**: Numeric and measurable, such as how much customers spend or how frequently they visit your site.
- **Qualitative Data**: Descriptive and contextual, such as online reviews or feedback about your products.

Both types of data are critical for understanding customer behavior and preferences.
