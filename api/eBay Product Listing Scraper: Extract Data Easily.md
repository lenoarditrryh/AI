## How to Scrape eBay Product Listings

### 1. Use the ImportFromWeb Add-On for Google Sheets

Install the **ImportFromWeb** add-on from the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/importfromweb_web_scraping_in_google_she/278587576794). Once installed, activate the add-on by navigating to **Extensions > ImportFromWeb > Activate add-on**.

#### Step 2: Input eBay Product URLs

ImportFromWeb requires two parameters: **URL** and **data selectors**. You can directly input the eBay product URLs into a spreadsheet or build them using item numbers.

For example:  
`="https://www.ebay.com/itm/"&A2` (where column A contains all your item numbers).

#### Step 3: Choose eBay Data Selectors

Data selectors specify the content you want to scrape from eBay product pages. Common selectors include:

- Title
- Price
- Shipping Price
- Return Policy
- Images

For a complete list of selectors, refer to the [eBay Selectors Glossary](https://nodatanobusiness.com/resources/importfromweb-ebay-product-data-selectors/).

### 2. Write and Execute the =IMPORTFROMWEB() Function

Use the formula `=IMPORTFROMWEB(URL, SELECTORS)` to scrape data. For example:  
`=IMPORTFROMWEB(B2, C1:E1)` retrieves product data from the URL in **B2** based on selectors in **C1:E1**.

Within seconds, your data will populate the sheet.

### 3. Scale the Collection Process

To scrape multiple products, use the formula with absolute references for selectors:  
`=IMPORTFROMWEB(B2, $C$1:$E$1)`

Drag the formula down to apply it to all rows in your spreadsheet.
